# the_super_generator

My motivation for this project was to create a something that would take the think out of intricate passwords. I built this because I am terrible at coming up with new passwords. 

This solves my problem of having poor passwords. While creating this masterpiece I feel like I have a better understanding of creating prompts, alerts, and confirms.
